Optimal Site Selection for Refugee Camps
==============


The R scripts in this repository are an implementation of the approach developped
in the study from gis4good 
(http://gisforgood5.weebly.com/uploads/3/0/6/3/30636149/gisfinalreport1.pdf)

The goal of this project was to determine how both environmental and social factors could be used
together to locate the best places for refugee camps and settlements. 

Using data and background knowledge available through global source, the script includes two scenarios to apply in
analyzing site suitability for refugee placement.
